      <h2>Introduction to Spring Boot</h2>
      <p>Spring Boot is a powerful, flexible framework built on top of the Spring Framework that simplifies the development of Java applications. It reduces the complexity of setting up and configuring an application by providing pre-configured templates, embedded servers, and essential libraries.</p>

      <h3>1. What is Spring Boot?</h3>
      <p>Spring Boot is a Java-based framework used to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It eliminates much of the boilerplate code that is typically associated with setting up a Spring application, allowing developers to focus on the core logic of their applications.</p>

      <h3>2. Overview of Spring Boot and Its Advantages</h3>
      <p>Spring Boot aims to simplify the development process by providing several out-of-the-box features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Auto Configuration:</strong> Spring Boot can automatically configure your application based on the libraries and dependencies you add to the project.</li>
        <li><strong>Embedded Servers:</strong> Spring Boot comes with embedded servers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow, so you don't need to deploy your application to an external server.</li>
        <li><strong>Starter Projects:</strong> Pre-configured sets of dependencies for specific tasks (e.g., Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security) to make adding functionality faster and easier.</li>
        <li><strong>Production-Ready Features:</strong> Spring Boot provides production-ready features like metrics, health checks, and application monitoring with minimal configuration.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Comparison with Spring Framework</h3>
      <p>Spring Boot and the traditional Spring Framework are both part of the Spring ecosystem, but they serve different purposes:</p>
      <table border="1" cellpadding="10">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Aspect</th>
            <th>Spring Boot</th>
            <th>Spring Framework</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Configuration</td>
            <td>Minimal configuration, auto-configuration based on dependencies.</td>
            <td>Requires manual configuration through XML or annotations.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Embedded Server</td>
            <td>Built-in embedded servers (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty).</td>
            <td>Requires external server configuration (e.g., Tomcat, JBoss).</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Development Speed</td>
            <td>Faster development with pre-configured templates and default setups.</td>
            <td>Slower, as developers must configure much of the application.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>4. Key Features of Spring Boot</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Auto Configuration:</strong> Spring Boot can automatically configure your application based on the dependencies available in the classpath. For example, if you include a database dependency, Spring Boot will automatically configure a DataSource for you.</li>
        <li><strong>Embedded Servers:</strong> Spring Boot eliminates the need for an external servlet container (like Tomcat or Jetty) by providing embedded servers. This makes deploying the application much simpler as the server is already bundled with the application.</li>
        <li><strong>Starter Projects:</strong> Starter projects are pre-configured dependencies that you can add to your application. These starters help you quickly add features such as web support, JPA, security, and more without having to search for the required dependencies manually.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Setting Up Spring Boot</h3>
      <p>To begin working with Spring Boot, you'll need to set up your development environment. Here are the steps for installation:</p>

      <h4>5.1 Installation of Java</h4>
      <p>Spring Boot requires JDK 8 or later. You can download and install the JDK from the official <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html" target="_blank">Oracle JDK download page</a>.</p>

      <h4>5.2 Installation of IDE</h4>
      <p>You can use any Java IDE to work with Spring Boot. Popular options include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>IntelliJ IDEA:</strong> A powerful IDE for Java development that provides excellent support for Spring Boot projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Eclipse:</strong> A widely-used open-source IDE that also supports Spring Boot development through the Spring Tools Suite (STS) plugin.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>5.3 Installing Spring Boot</h4>
      <p>Spring Boot can be installed through either Maven or Gradle as a dependency in your project, or you can use Spring Initializr (a web-based tool) to generate your Spring Boot project.</p>

      <h3>6. Introduction to Spring Initializr</h3>
      <p>Spring Initializr is a web-based tool that helps you quickly generate a Spring Boot project with your desired dependencies. You can access it at <a href="https://start.spring.io" target="_blank">Spring Initializr</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select your project metadata (Group, Artifact, Name, etc.).</li>
        <li>Choose your build tool (Maven or Gradle).</li>
        <li>Choose your Java version.</li>
        <li>Add dependencies such as Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and more.</li>
        <li>Click "Generate" to download the zip file containing your project.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>6.1 Example of Using Spring Initializr</h4>
      <p>Once you generate your Spring Boot project from Spring Initializr, you can unzip the project and import it into your IDE. Hereâ€™s an example of how to create a basic Spring Boot project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://start.spring.io" target="_blank">Spring Initializr</a>.</li>
        <li>Choose the following settings:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Project:</strong> Maven Project</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Java</li>
            <li><strong>Spring Boot:</strong> Choose the latest stable version</li>
            <li><strong>Group:</strong> com.example</li>
            <li><strong>Artifact:</strong> demo</li>
            <li><strong>Dependencies:</strong> Add "Spring Web" and "Spring Boot DevTools"</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Click "Generate" and download the project zip file.</li>
        <li>Unzip and open it in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Spring Boot simplifies Java development by reducing the need for manual configuration, offering powerful features like auto-configuration, embedded servers, and starter projects. With the help of Spring Initializr, you can easily set up and create your Spring Boot applications with minimal effort.</p>
